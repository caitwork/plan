Perfect. Let's now fully consolidate **everything you want to learn** into a clean, organized, updated **Master Theory & Skill List**, grouped by category *with actual names* instead of numbers ‚Äî then I‚Äôll update the **job-role-to-skills mapping** below that too.

This version includes:

* ‚úÖ Your existing cybersecurity path
* ‚úÖ Additional tools/skills from QA, development, and data roles
* ‚úÖ Clean readable structure so you can use this as your master checklist
